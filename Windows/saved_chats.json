It has a thinking budget range of 128 to 32768 and cannot disable thinking. Setting `thinkingBudget = -1` enables dynamic thinking.\n\n*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash** also uses dynamic thinking by default. Its thinking budget ranges from 0 to 24576. Thinking can be disabled by setting `thinkingBudget = 0`, and dynamic thinking is enabled with `thinkingBudget = -1`.\n\n*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite** does not think by default. Its thinking budget ranges from 512 to 24576. Thinking is disabled with `thinkingBudget = 0`, and dynamic thinking is enabled with `thinkingBudget = -1`."
